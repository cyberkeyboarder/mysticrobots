Items to figure out
- Identify how we'll store the high scores
- Devise a solver
- Single player, Single Player vs computer, 2-player, 2-player over network, websocket, integrations?
- Identify all the different types of plays aside from single player (which would be the first one)

## Solver
The largest problem to solve which may enable us to offer varying levels of complexity in the game is the solver. How do you devise a way to get a specific robot into the goal in the smallest number of moves. Alone is one level, and using the other robots is another level of complexity.
